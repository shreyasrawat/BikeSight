          <p>At BikeSight, we believe safety should never be optional—especially for our youngest riders. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi, LED alerts, a high-res camera, OpenCV object detection, a loud buzzer, and a portable power bank to create a real-time safety shield. When someone gets too close, BikeSight instantly alerts the rider, giving them the critical seconds they need to stay safe.</p>
