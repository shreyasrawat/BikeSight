            <p>BykeSyte is a smart safety device that easily attaches to your bike and alerts you when a car approaches dangerously close, helping you stay aware and protected on the road. Inspired by a real incident at our school — where a student was struck while crossing — we created BykeSyte to make biking safer for everyone.
Installation is quick and simple, taking less than 10 minutes. Whether you're commuting, exercising, or just out for a ride, BykeSyte is an essential companion for every cyclist who values safety. Here's how it works:
